# Forecasting and Budgeting Quickstart

As an enhancement to Yotascale's CloudOps Reports, Forecasting and Budgeting provides the user with the results of predictive modeling to indicate where if their cloud service costs will be within their monthly allocated budget. 

## Resource Dashboard

The **Resource Dashboard** provides a quick overview of your costs, budget and forecasted costs. To get to the **Resource Dashboard** click the **Analytics** button at the top of the **Cloud Operations Report** screen.

Once the **Resource Dashboard** loads you are presented with tabular budget data for the **Perspectives** you established when configuring Yotascale. Each **Perspective** displays its *Monthly Budget*, *Cost*, *Cost Vs Budget*, *Forecasted Cost*, *Forecasted Cost Vs Budget* and a *Last 30 Days*, which indicates if cost are trending upwards or downwards.

## Forecasted Cost

Using **Yotascales** predicitve modeling a forecasted cost can now be presented. This analysis is an indicator of whether, by the end of the month bwing viewed, your cost will exceed allocated budget for this **Perspective**. 

## Forecasted Cost Vs Budget

A visual indciator of whether your forecasted cost will exceed your allocated budget for this **Perspective**. Scrolling over the **Forecasted Cost Vs Budget** bar presents a popover which details the forecasted cost versus budget analysis with an over or under percentage.

## Forecasted Cost Detailed Summmary

The **Forecated Cost Summary** provides you with both a cost summary analysis of your forcasted cost for the selected month versus your current budget as well as a graph which charts the cost increases over time. 

Follow these steps to view the **Forecasted Cost Summary**

1. From the **Resource Dashboard** click on the **Perspective** name. 
2. A screen will load that contains the historical cost for the **Perspective**
3. From this screen click on the **Forecasting and Budget** button in the subnavigation.

The **Forecasted Cost Summary** will display. This view provides you with a cost summary of the **Perspective** for the current month. This summary includes:

 - Cost
 - Budget
 - Cost Vs Budget
 - Forecast (Forecasted cost)
 - Budget Vs Forecast

 Below this summary is a forecast graph, which show, based on Yotascales's predictive analysis, whether your cost will increase or decrease, an incremental scale for that change and a breakpoint indicating where the change will cross above or below your allocated budget.

 The graph line is centered on a blue background. Because there is some level of ambiguity in forecasting this background represents a forecast range and the **Prediction Confidence Level**, a percentage indicating Yotascale's confidence that your forecasted cost will fall within this range.

Hovering over the graph at any point will display a popover which provides more details on the **Prediction Confidence Level** to include the price range of each confidence level forecast.
